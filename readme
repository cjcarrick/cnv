cnv

This is a POSIX shell script that invokes other programs to convert files.

The goal of this script is to remember obscure shell commands so you don't have
to. It is similar in philosophy to mitsuhiko's unp utility, the main difference
being that unp depends on python, making it less portable.

Examples:

	# use fontforge to convert a woff font to otf:
	cnv file1.woff otf

	# Create file1.jpg, file2.jpg, and file3.jpg from file1.png, file1.jpeg, and
	# file2.TIFF (file2.jpeg is just copied).
	cnv file1.png file2.jpeg file2.TIFF jpg


As of right now, not a lot of filetypes are supported. I plan on adding more as
I encounter them.
